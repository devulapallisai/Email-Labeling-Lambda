# Email-Labeling-Lambda

Email labelling project:

Team members: Akhil Gattu, Sai Prachodhan Devulapalli, Deepak Reddy, Aaseesh, Shreyansh Agarwal, Hashish Yenugula

## Project plans:

#### 1)We plan to make the project as a browser extension that can be enabled as soon as the user logs into their gmail account.
#### 2)The extension can use regex to extract mails based on the subject and body of a particular mail and label it accordingly.
#### 3)We then use temporary browser storage to store the data of no. of mails classified under a particular label.
#### 4)We could use a database as an alternative and later use python libraries like pandas,matplotlib and seaborn to generate analytics based on data.
#### 5)We plan to add additional features like scheduling course assignments based on google classroomâ€™s deadlines, reminder to not eat mess food on a particular day if there are too many mess related complaints, covid-support etc.
#### 6)(Additional/optional plan) We plan to enable users to share data pertaining to their email labels if they wish to anonymously, and create a cumulative report for the IIT-H community.
